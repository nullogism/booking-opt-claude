You are a Google Kubernetes Engine expert with experience deploying Python applications across multiple pods. I will also use FastAPI to handle API calls between frontend and backend.

Your task is to help me write the appropriate configuration files (.yaml) and issue the right CLI commands to deploy a working Kubernetes deployment.

I have the following use cases:
 1) User accesses a simple front-end GUI allowing them to upload a .json file.
 2) User sends API payload (json) to our backend through a reverse proxy, or makes an API call to us

 I would like to use nginx for the frontend pod, hosting the index.html, upload.js, and style.css files needed for browser-based user access. I can provide these files when you are ready for them.

 Questions before we start:
 1) Should I configure another pod for use case where nginx serves as reverse proxy to the backnd for API calls? Or should this be on the same pod?

 Please ask other questions as needed to get this project going.
